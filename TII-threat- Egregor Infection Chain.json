The commodity malware is used for stealing sensitive data and lateral movement. Furthermore, CobaltStrike beacons are deployed for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Eventually the attacker compromises Active Directory and obtains domain admin privileges. With this access, scripts, DLLs, and additional files are downloaded from a C2 server. Included in these downloaded files are a batch file and a ZIP file. The batch file is used to download and execute the Egregor ransomware. The ZIP file contains the RClone client, masquerading as svchost, which is leveraged to exfiltrate files from the victim network. The Egregor ransomware can only be executed if it is passed a correct decryption key, otherwise execution will fail, increasing the difficulty of analysis. Victims are provided a short period of time to pay the ransomware, which is negotiated via chat. If the ransom goes unpaid, the stolen files are published on a Tor website operated by the attackers.

Campaigns begin with a phishing email with a malicious Word document attached. These maldocs deliver a commodity malware, such as Qbot, Ursnif or IcedID. The commodity malware is used for stealing sensitive data and lateral movement. Furthermore, CobaltStrike beacons are deployed for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Eventually the attacker compromises Active Directory and obtains domain admin privileges. With this access, scripts, DLLs, and additional files are downloaded from a C2 server. Included in these downloaded files are a batch file and a ZIP file. The batch file is used to download and execute the Egregor ransomware. The ZIP file contains the RClone client, masquerading as svchost, which is leveraged to exfiltrate files from the victim network. The Egregor ransomware can only be executed if it is passed a correct decryption key, otherwise execution will fail, increasing the difficulty of analysis. Victims are provided a short period of time to pay the ransomware, which is negotiated via chat. If the ransom goes unpaid, the stolen files are published on a Tor website operated by the attackers.
